	The program we coded is a game based application called Mine Maze. The objective of the game is to get to the end within the limited 
  amount of moves and without using too much of your lives by stepping on random mines.  This game runs off of multiple functions with 2-D 
  arrays and the “cout-ing” functions learn throughout this course. The troubles that occurred with this project include movement 
  throughout the maps, randomizing the mines, and actually being a group in this project. We solved the movement problem because Evan did 
  research and found a function to make the player move my just entering W A S or D making the gameplay much more easier for the user. We 
  also solved the randomizing the mine problem by having a different grid just for random mines for each level. This works by having the 
  user move within two 2-D arrays but, only showing them the mine map, I thought this would be easier instead of having one 2-D with 
  multiple checks in it. The last problem was solved by communicating better using texts, email, and actually working on the project as a 
  whole instead of having us to do each map by ourselves. We got more done this way then by doing it on our own.
